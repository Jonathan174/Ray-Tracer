# Ray-Tracer
My only Ray-Tracer so far, is a very interesting project, it was led by the hand until the application of the physical formulas to refract and reflect the light for each material. The different figures and the creation of scenes are something that takes time since I looked for the right combination of effects according to what I wanted to convey in my scene.

Scene 1, combination with reflection and refraction.

Scene 2, refraction through various objects.
